# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the analysis:
Create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Since the data we have is not ideal, it needed to be processed to fit the machine learning models. I used unsupervised learning.
Here are the steps:
- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results.
